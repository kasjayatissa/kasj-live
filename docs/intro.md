# Documentation

I see this area as a quick reference guide to complement my [blog](../blog/). It contains the all the key commands without any of the fluff. I hope to also use it as a spot to capture a backlog of things to try and useful kubernetes commands along the way.

* [Useful Kubernetes Commands](/docs/kube-commands)
* [Backlog](/docs/backlog)

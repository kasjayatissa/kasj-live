But what about storage? If we use a pod\'s local filesystem for a given application and that pod is deleted, the application data disappears with it. To solve for this, we need to leverage kubernetes **storage classes**. Kubernetes supports a number of [various storage classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#provisioner) ranging from public cloud storage offering to local file storage. Think the best option for me is a [NFS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#nfs)\\n\\n## Installing an NFS server\\n\\nSo if I were to do this properly, I\'d be running a NAS or NFS box but since I\'ve skimped on the hardware, I\'ll be installing a NFS server on the same server as my cluster. You might be thinking *\\"mate, that\'s just the same as local storage\\"* and you would be right but I wanted to eventually switch to a separate NAS so figured I\'d just learn how to do this.\\n\\nThere are plenty of tutorials available on how to install NFS on Ubuntu but i followed this one. Here are the key commands I took away to get the job done:\\n\\nInstall the NFS server and export `/nfs` which is accessible by the Kubernetes cluster:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo su\\napt update && apt -y upgrade\\napt install -y nfs-server\\nexit\\n\\nmkdir /nfs\\ncat << EOF >> /etc/exports\\n/nfs 192.168.86.41(rw,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)\\nEOF\\n\\nsystemctl enable --now nfs-server\\nexportfs -ar\\n```\\n\\nIf I ever add another node to my cluster I need to ensure that a NFS client package is installed  able to connect to the NFS server but this isn\'t required as my NFS server is the same as my Kubernetes node:\\n\\n```bash\\napt install -y nfs-common\\n```\\n\\n## Persistent Volumes\\n\\nNow that I have a storage location, it is probably worth mentioning that the kubernetes rescource associated to persistent storage is **Persistent Volumes**. Like any other resource, I can provision persistent volumes declaritively to whatever storage class I specify.\\n\\nOnce a persistent volume is created, an application deployment can leverage the persistent volume using a **Persistent Volume Claim**. I could be wrong here but I think only one persistent volume claim can be applied to a persistent volume.\\n\\n## Dynamic Provisioning of Persistent Volumes\\n\\nKubernetes also provides you the ability to dynamically provision storage to applications. I found a nifty little tool that someone made called [NFS subdir external provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner) which is an automatic provisioner that uses your existing and already configured NFS server to support dynamic provisioning of Kubernetes Persistent Volumes via Persistent Volume Claims. Persistent volumes are provisioned as `${namespace}-${pvcName}-${pvName}`. To install this I run:\\n\\n```bash\\nhelm repo add nfs-subdir-external-provisioner https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner\\n\\nhelm install nfs-subdir-external-provisioner nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner \\\\\\n  --create-namespace \\\\\\n  --namespace nfs-provisioner \\\\\\n  --set nfs.server=192.168.86.41 \\\\\\n  --set nfs.path=/nfs\\n```\\n\\n## Testing the provisioner\\n\\nTo test the provisioner I run:\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl get sc\\n```\\n\\n![nfs](nfs.png)\\n\\nAnd will use following persistent volume claim manifest:\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\\nmetadata:\\n  name: nfs-test\\n  labels:\\n    storage.k8s.io/name: nfs\\n    storage.k8s.io/part-of: kubernetes-complete-reference\\n    storage.k8s.io/created-by: ssbostan\\nspec:\\n  accessModes:\\n    - ReadWriteMany\\n  storageClassName: nfs-client\\n  resources:\\n    requests:\\n      storage: 1Gi\\n```\\n\\nThings of note here:\\n\\n* `name` will vary for each volume claim - I will use the convention of `<app_name>-pvc`\\n* `labels` doesn\'t change for my needs\\n* `accessModes` doesn\'t change for my needs\\n* `storageClassName` doesn\'t change for my needs\\n* `storage` will vary for the app but worth noting that the whole specified range is provisioned (not just what you use)\\n\\n\\n\\nThat covers all the core cluster services I reckon, time to install some apps!"},{"id":"certs","metadata":{"permalink":"/kasj-live/blog/certs","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-25-letsencrypt/index.md","title":"Certificates for HTTPS","description":"Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Certificates can are usually provided through issuers.

You guessed it - mine is `kasj.live`. From there I needed to obtain an cloudflare token which was a personal access token to manage my DNS records in my cloudflare account. I needed this as I needed to provide it to cert-manager, which will be brokering the certificates between letsencrypt and my domain.\\n\\nProviding cert-manager my cloudflare token could be done with a simple manifest:\\n\\n```yaml title=secret-cf-token.yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n  name: cloudflare-token-secret\\n  namespace: cert-manager\\ntype: Opaque\\nstringData:\\n  cloudflare-token: <redacted>\\n```\\n\\nTo apply the manifest run:\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl apply -f secret-cf-token.yaml\\n```\\n\\n## Adding Let\'s Encrypt as an Issuer to cert-manager\\n\\nI now need to let cert-manager know that I\'ll be using Let\'s Encrypt as my certificate issuer of choice through another manifest:\\n\\n```yaml title=\\"letsencrypt-production.yaml\\"\\napiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1\\nkind: ClusterIssuer\\nmetadata:\\n  name: letsencrypt-production\\nspec:\\n  acme:\\n    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory\\n    email: kasunj@gmail.com\\n    privateKeySecretRef:\\n      name: letsencrypt-production\\n    solvers:\\n      - dns01:\\n          cloudflare:\\n            email: kasunj@gmail.com\\n            apiTokenSecretRef:\\n              name: cloudflare-token-secret\\n              key: cloudflare-token\\n        selector:\\n          dnsZones:\\n            - \\"kasj.live\\"\\n```\\n\\nand execute using:\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl apply -f letsencrypt-production.yaml\\n```\\n\\n## Issuing certificates\\n\\nWith the issuer now configured, all I need to do is request for a certificate. I will be hosting all my internal applications under the subdomain `local.kasj.live` so i will request for a wildcard certicate that covers `*.local.kasj.live`\\n\\nThe certificate is issued with the following manifest:\\n\\n```yaml title=\\"local-kasj-live.yaml\\"\\napiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1\\nkind: Certificate\\nmetadata:\\n  name: local-kasj-live\\n  namespace: default\\nspec:\\n  secretName: local-kasj-live-tls\\n  issuerRef:\\n    name: letsencrypt-production\\n    kind: ClusterIssuer\\n  commonName: \\"*.local.kasj.live\\"\\n  dnsNames:\\n  - \\"local.kasj.live\\"\\n  - \\"*.local.kasj.live\\"\\n```\\n\\nand execute using:\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl apply -f local-kasj-live.yaml\\n```\\n\\nIssuing  and validating the certificates takes time (20 minutes minimum). To check how things are progressing run:\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl get challenges\\n```\\n\\n:::caution\\n\\nYou\'ll notice that I use the issuer name `letsencrypt-production` - I didn\'t jump straight to this but rather used `letsencrypt-staging` first to make sure all my configuration was correct. If you jump straight to production but if it doesn\'t work for whatever reason you might be locked out by letsencrypt for a period of time.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Testing the issued certificate\\n\\nOnce the `kubectl get challenges` command produces nothing, that\'s when you know the process is complete. To use a certificate, you need to ensure a couple of things:\\n\\n* The certificate needs to be made available in multiple namespaces. The certificate only works if it is deployed in the same namespaces as the service you are using it for. With a bit of googling I\'ve been using the following [solution](https://github.com/mittwald/kubernetes-replicator) for this.\\n\\n* We use Traefik to specify and `ingressRoute` which essentionally provides traefik with the instructions on where to route traffic hitting the reverse proxy. We can also specify here that a certificate must be used.\\n\\nTo test above, I deployed the Traefik dashboard (with the help of their documentation and TechnoTim) with the following steps:\\n\\nCreate and deploy a middleware manifest that forces https:\\n\\n```yaml title=\\"middleware.yaml\\"\\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\\nkind: Middleware\\nmetadata:\\n  name: traefik-dashboard-basicauth\\n  namespace: traefik\\nspec:\\n  basicAuth:\\n    secret: traefik-dashboard-auth\\n```\\n\\nGenerate a credential whichi is mandatory for the dashboard:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Generate a credential / password that\u2019s base64 encoded\\nhtpasswd -nb kas <redacted> | openssl base64\\n```\\n\\nCreate and apply a manifest to deploy the dashboard. Note you need to use the output from command above for the password:\\n\\n```yaml\\n---\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Secret\\nmetadata:\\n  name: traefik-dashboard-auth\\n  namespace: traefik\\ntype: Opaque\\ndata:\\n  users: <redacted hased password which is output from above>\\n```\\n\\nFinally I create a manifest for an `ingressRoute` which will route traffic from `traefik.local.kasj.live` to my dashboard using TLS certificate I just created:\\n\\n```yaml title=\\"traefik-ingress.yaml\\"\\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1\\nkind: IngressRoute\\nmetadata:\\n  name: traefik-dashboard\\n  namespace: traefik\\n  annotations:\\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik-external\\nspec:\\n  entryPoints:\\n    - websecure\\n  routes:\\n    - match: Host(`traefik.local.kasj.live`)\\n      kind: Rule\\n      middlewares:\\n        - name: traefik-dashboard-basicauth\\n          namespace: traefik\\n      services:\\n        - name: api@internal\\n          kind: TraefikService\\n  tls:\\n    secretName: local-kasj-live-tls\\n```\\n\\n## And the results\\n\\nSo now if I navigate to `https://traefik.local.kasj.live` I can not see the traefik dashboard\\n\\n![traefik](traefik.png)\\n\\nAnd more importantly with a certificate issued from Let\'s Encrypt!\\n\\n![cert](cert.png)"},{"id":"cert-manager","metadata":{"permalink":"/kasj-live/blog/cert-manager","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-24-certmanager/index.md","title":"Certificate manager for cluster","description":"Certificates in K3s","date":"2023-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 24, 2023","tags":[{"label":"cert-manager","permalink":"/kasj-live/blog/tags/cert-manager"},{"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/kasj-live/blog/tags/kubernetes"}],"readingTime":0.855,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kas J","title":"Author","url":"https://github.com/kasjayatissa","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90017589?v=4","key":"kas"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"cert-manager","title":"Certificate manager for cluster","authors":["kas"],"tags":["cert-manager","kubernetes"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Certificates for HTTPS","permalink":"/kasj-live/blog/certs"},"nextItem":{"title":"Cluster reverse proxy","permalink":"/kasj-live/blog/traefik"}},"content":"## Certificates in K3s\\n\\nIn my previous post I mentioned that Traefik allows me to provide SSL termination certificate handling.

It\'s up and running but how do I access it when it is only routable within my cluster. if you look at the pods IP addresses, they are all *10.1.x.x* which is not in my home network.\\n\\nWell, the answer is I need use a load balancer to expose that web server outside the cluster so that I can see it on my home network. When working in public cloud, these load balancers are usually provided by the cloud providers but I need one for my locally hosted environment.\\n\\nAfter a bit of research, I found that [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/) is the best solution for this. You give it a \\"pool\\" of IP addresses within your home network to allocate to services that you want to expose and it just does it (much like a DHCP server)\\n\\n## Installing applications\\n\\nSo this is my first app that I am going to install on my cluster so it took me a little bit of reading to get to this point but here are my key takeaways of installing this and any app:\\n\\n* You can specify kubernetes a *manifest* which is basically a yaml file which allows you to declaritively specify what you want to install, where to install it from and what configurations you want and how to expose it.\\n* Most container applications are containerised with docker and often come with an associated docker-compose file. There is a nifty tool called [kompose](https://kompose.io/) which allows you to take these docker-compose files and it converts it to a kubernetes manifest for you to allow it to be deployed to your cluster - I plan on using this a lot.\\n* Another popular way of installing application is Helm. Helm is a package manager similar to apt (if you\'re familiar with Ubuntu) which allows you to easily install applications on to your cluster. All you need to do is specify the repo for the application you are wanting to install and it does the rest - I plan on using this a lot too.\\n\\n## Installing metallb\\n\\nInstalling metallb is pretty easy out of the box. You are already provided with manifest to deploy using the **kubectl apply** command:\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.13.9/config/manifests/metallb-native.yaml\\n```\\n\\nThis installs metallb into a new **namespace** called **metallb-system**. Namespaces are a kubenetes construct that basically allow you a way to organise resources within your cluster. I like to think of them as \\"folders\\" in a typical file system. So for metallb, all my resources will live in the metallb-system namespace. This allows for easy troubleshooting in the future as I know where they all live.\\n\\n\\n## Configuring metallb\\n\\nOnce installed, there were some configuration changes that needed to be made. As mentioned earlier, I needed to specify a pool of IP address for metallb to allocate out. I put this into another yaml file:\\n\\n```yaml title=\\"/home-lab/cluster-setup/metallb/metallb-ipconfig.yaml\\"\\napiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1\\nkind: IPAddressPool\\nmetadata:\\n  name: first-pool\\n  namespace: metallb-system\\nspec:\\n  addresses:\\n  - 192.168.86.100-192.168.86.110\\n\\n---\\napiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1\\nkind: L2Advertisement\\nmetadata:\\n  name: default\\n  namespace: metallb-system\\n```\\n\\n## Verifying installation\\n\\nAll done! Here are a few commands to verify my install:\\n\\n![metallbverify](metallbverify.png)\\n\\nBut the real test is if it will allocate an IP to a service. Let\'s test it with reverse proxy service. Stay tuned as I will cover this in my next post!"},{"id":"k3s","metadata":{"permalink":"/kasj-live/blog/k3s","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-21-k3s/index.md","title":"Kubernetes cluster - K3s","description":"So with my hardware set up, it was time to get my software up and running.

There are plenty of open source options out there but I stuck with trusty [Ubuntu Server 22.04.1 LTS ](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)\\n\\n## K8s vs K3s\\n\\nBefore I got stuck into deploying my kubernetes I wanted to investigate what options I had for a homelab. It boiled down to two main ones: K8s vs K3s. Both K8s and K3s share the same source code but the key difference for me was that K3s was significantly more lightweight, can be deployed much faster and still all all the key capabilities of K8s. There are a number of \\"production grade\\" features that are excluded from K3s such has handling of complex applications and intergrations with public cloud providers which I didn\'t require.\\n\\n## Installing K3s\\n\\nInstalling K3s couldn\'t be more easier out of the box and it takes no time at all. I simply needed to ssh into my freshly install ubuntu server and execute the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh - \\n```\\n\\nand to uninstall it is:\\n\\n```bash\\n/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh\\n```\\n\\nI must admit I ran these commands **ALOT** because there were a number of things that were installed by default which I didn\'t need (yet). I\'m not going to get into the various customisable configuration options here but there is some pretty good [documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/configuration) for it. After tweaking my configuration, I ended up with the following command to install the cluster I wanted:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE=\\"644\\" INSTALL_K3S_EXEC=\\"--disable traefik --disable servicelb --disable kube-proxy --disable local-storage --cluster-init --tls-san 10.43.0.1\\" sh -s -\\n```\\n\\n## Accessing my K3s cluster\\n\\nOk time to run my first kubectl command. To verify that everything was running properly I run:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo kubectl get nodes\\n```\\n\\nwhich shows me my single node in my cluster is up and running:\\n\\n![getnodes](./getnodes.png)\\n\\nI needed to run it in sudo which I thought was annoying -I had to fix this (OCD much?). The K3s kubeconfig file is stored at a rancher location /etc/rancher/k3s. \\nI *think* this is why I needed to run kubectl in sudo. So I ran the following steps to rectify that:\\n\\nCreate .kube directory in my home directory\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo mkdir /home/kas/.kube\\n```\\n\\nCopy the kubeconfig file into the newly created directory\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml /home/kas/.kube/config\\n```\\n\\nChange ownership of the directory so that root wasn\'t needed\\n```bash\\nsudo chown kas:kas /home/kas/.kube/config\\n```\\nLet K3s know the location of the new config file (and hopefully the last time I have to use sudo for kubectl)\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo kubectl config set-cluster default --server=https://192.168.86.41:6443 --kubeconfig /home/kas/.kube/config\\n```\\n\\nI wanted to ensure I could access my cluster from my laptop without having to SSH into my ubuntu server (k3smaster) everytime. To do this I needed copy the kubeconfig file across to my laptop using scp:\\n\\nFrom my laptop I run:\\n\\n```bash\\nscp k3smaster:/home/kas/.kube/config /home/kas/.kube/config\\n```\\n\\n...and I\'m laughing::\\n\\n![getnodes](./getnodes-lappa.png)"},{"id":"hardware","metadata":{"permalink":"/kasj-live/blog/hardware","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-17-hardware/index.md","title":"Gear up","description":"I\'ve normally resorted to buying raspberry pi\'s (I now have a Model 2B, 3B and 4) and don\'t have any major self-hosting requirements so I considered clustering them together.

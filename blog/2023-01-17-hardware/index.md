I've normally resorted to buying raspberry pi's (I now have a Model 2B, 3B and 4) and don't have any major self-hosting requirements so I considered clustering them together. Given the current ARM architecture limitations on the older models, I decided I will bite the bullet and buy some more dedicated hardware. I also figured I could:

* Add the raspberry pi's into the cluster for some more resources if need be at a later date. 
* Use the raspberry pi's as an isolated sandbox for testing

With Raspberry Pi 4's currently in low stocks, I started exploring mini PCs/NUCs. They are actually pretty cool, the specs are much better, the costs aren't that much higher and they are built to last.

I ended up getting [Intel NUC 11 Essential Kit Celeron N4505 (Atlas Canyon)](https://www.centrecom.com.au/intel-nuc-11-essential-kit-celeron-n4505-atlas-canyon) which was on special at CentreCom. I unboxed and plugged it in immediately only to realise that it is pretty barebones unfortunately.

The site doesn't cover it but it doesn't come with any pre-installed HDD or RAM (that's why it was cheap!) so I needed to get those off Amazon. Here's what I bought:

2 X [8GB DDR4 RAM](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B08C4Z69LN?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)

1 x [500GB SSD Hard Drive](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418VuyafoUL._AC_SL1075_.jpg)

Installing them were pretty easy - plug n play, I was then ready to rock n roll!

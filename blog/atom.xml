        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past couple of weeks, I've been experimenting quite a bit on my server (installing, uninstalling, changing config everywhere). Before I started installing and using my apps in anger I thought it might be best to start clean. This was also a great opporunity to learn Ansible to automate the entire cluster set up.</p><p>I've been using Terraform quite a bit as part of my day job and for me Ansible is Terraform's perfect partner in crime. Terraform sets up the infrastructure and Ansible then goes over the top and installs the configuration. Both tools operate under the same way, configurations describe the state that you need in a declarative manner. So for cluster set up my target is to automate the following tasks after a fresh version of Ubuntu is installed:</p><ol><li>Install K3s</li><li>Install load balancer Metallb</li><li>Install NFS server</li><li>Install reverse proxy Traefik</li><li>Install Cert Manager and Certificates</li><li>Install ArgoCD (which will deploy all my apps - more on this in a future post)</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ansible-playbooks-and-roles">Ansible playbooks and roles<a href="#ansible-playbooks-and-roles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ansible playbooks and roles" title="Direct link to Ansible playbooks and roles">​</a></h2><p>Ansible configurations are written in a file which contains all the various config tasks that are needed to be run along with instructions to execute these tasks called <strong>ansible playbooks</strong>. You could theoretically write one big playbook to automate all the tasks above but it is easier to keep things modular. This is where <strong>ansible roles</strong> comes in - roles are simply a more modular version of a playbook which contains its own file structure, variables and handlers. More importantly for me, grouping things by roles allow you to share your playbooks easier with other users. </p><p>Through the wonderful open source community I was able to source some great roles through Ansible galaxy (Ansible role marketplace) and Github, I was able to source and tweak the following roles:</p><ul><li>Techno Tim's role to install <a href="https://github.com/techno-tim/k3s-ansible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K3s and Metallb</a></li><li>Jeff Geerling's role to install <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/nfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFS server</a></li><li>Githubixx's role to install <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/githubixx/cert_manager_kubernetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cert-manager</a> and <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/githubixx/traefik_kubernetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traefik</a></li><li>Reefland's role to install <a href="https://github.com/reefland/ansible-k3s-argocd-renovate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArgoCD</a></li></ul><p>Honestly, I didn't need to make many tweaks to these playbooks at all, if anything I needed to remove tasks because they were doing more than I needed to do. All I needed to do was point these playbooks to my local servers, ensure I had SSH connectivity and the playbooks did the rest - Pretty cool!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest reasons for creating a homelab is I wanted the ability to leverage the some of the great services and solutions that were available in the public cloud within the safety of my home network where my data was out of reach in the wild world of the internet. I can't think of a better example of this than Password Management. </p><p>The last 12 months have been incredibly eye opening for a lot of folks when it comes to data privacy with some pretty large breaches impacting millions of people. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/notifiable-data-breaches/notifiable-data-breaches-publications/notifiable-data-breaches-report-july-to-december-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> 497 breaches were notified compared with 393 in January to June 2022 – a 26% increase, most of which were malicious or criminal attacks.</p><p>So many of us (me included) have so many accounts/subscriptions/emails, it is very hard for us to keep up with strong password requirements and practices. Luckily for us there are a number of excellent solutions to generate and manage passwords for us so we don't have to. Passwords can now be long and complicated which dramatically reduce the chances of being hacked or exploited. </p><p>I've been using <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LastPass</a> for a number of years and has served me well however late last year I was reminded that there will be attempts to access your data. In December 2022, "an unauthorized party gained access to a third-party cloud-based storage service, which LastPass uses to store archived backups of our production data. Whilst no customer data was accessed during the August 2022 incident, some source code and technical information were stolen from our development environment and used to target another employee, obtaining credentials and keys which were used to access and decrypt some storage volumes within the cloud-based storage service." <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p><p>I know, no customer data was stolen and even if the customer data was stolen, it is all encrypted anyway. Also, if I wasn't using LastPass, there was far more of chance I re-use or use weak passwords making it more likely to be exploited.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="there-is-always-a-self-hosted-alternative">There is always a self-hosted alternative<a href="#there-is-always-a-self-hosted-alternative" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to There is always a self-hosted alternative" title="Direct link to There is always a self-hosted alternative">​</a></h2><p>Having a free, open-source alternative to a service I would've normally paid for is awesome but this one felt really good. Enter <a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden</a>. It is a fantastic, self-hosted, free alternative password manager that does pretty much everything LastPass does (all the features I've been using anyway). Passwords are encrypted, it comes with an official Android and IoS app so that you can access your passwords from your phone and most importantly everything is stored locally.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="installing-bitwarden">Installing Bitwarden<a href="#installing-bitwarden" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installing Bitwarden" title="Direct link to Installing Bitwarden">​</a></h2><p>I was gearing up to write some manifests when I found a great <a href="https://github.com/guerzon/bitwarden-kubernetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo</a> that had some great ones pre-written. Some minor tweaks and it all deployed fine. </p><p>One thing I deliberately didn't configure was a mail server (which Bitwarden needs to send out an email verification or send you a password hint if needed). I plan on revisiting this after I deploy a small mail server later.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-bitwarden">Using Bitwarden<a href="#using-bitwarden" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Using Bitwarden" title="Direct link to Using Bitwarden">​</a></h2><p>Using Bitwarden couldn't be easier either, it even comes with a handy little <!-- -->[guide(https://bitwarden.com/help/import-from-lastpass/)]<!-- --> to help you import all your passwords from LastPass</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="bitwarden" src="/assets/images/bitwarden-845582bbe1a3e9a9a16e8c983316e1b6.png" width="2147" height="1402" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts<a href="#closing-thoughts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Closing thoughts" title="Direct link to Closing thoughts">​</a></h2><p>Password managers are a must have service for everyone and whilst there are a number pretty great cloud-based password managers out there (Google and Apple included), it is quite nice knowing that I don't have to store my data encrypted or otherwise on a server somewhere that isn't one that I own and know. For that reason (and really that reason alone) I'll be sticking to Bitwarden.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0G17mcoGBEabVgn6/giphy.gif" alt="password" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In an earlier post, I installed cert-manager to automatically manage my SSL certificates for TLS for my home-lab services. Given it was a set of services within my internal network, I was comfortable with issuing a single wildcard certificate <code>*.local.kasj.live</code>. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem">The problem<a href="#the-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The problem" title="Direct link to The problem">​</a></h2><p>I've since realised a bit of an issue. The wildcard certificates that are issued are issued as a kubernetes <code>secret</code> resource which is specific to a namespace. This meant that in order for me to use the wildcard cert for all my services, I needed to deploy all my services into the same namespace (not ideal). </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-research">The research<a href="#the-research" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The research" title="Direct link to The research">​</a></h2><p>Turns out there were many solutions to this, many of which I don't really understand but I tried anyway. This included:</p><ul><li><a href="https://major.io/2021/08/16/wildcard-letsencrypt-certificates-traefik-cloudflare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Installing traefik again with K3s out of the box</a> and getting it to issue certs through Let's Encrypt without cert-manager. This didn't seem to change the behaviour I was experiencing before.</li><li><a href="https://lachlan.io/blog/using-wildcard-certificates-with-traefik-and-k3s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Storing the wildcard secret in a persistent volume</a> for cert-manager to pick up as a "default" certificate when nothing else was provided. Unfortunately I couldn't get the persistent volume to work either</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-solution">The solution<a href="#the-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The solution" title="Direct link to The solution">​</a></h2><p>I landed with a solution outline <a href="https://itobey.dev/wildcard-certificates-dns-challenges-and-traefik-in-kubernetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and it still doesn't work how I want it to but its definitely a step forward. </p><p>The first few steps are exactly as I'd performed in my earlier post:</p><ol><li>Install Traefik</li><li>Install Cert-Manager</li><li>Set up Let's Encrypt as an Issuer</li></ol><p>This is where I learnt something new:</p><ol start="4"><li>Issue a wilcard certificate in the <strong>same namespace as Traefik</strong> in my case this was the <code>kube-system</code> namespace - I also issued myself a new one here to keep things fresh <code>*.home.kasj.live</code></li></ol><div class="language-yaml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block"

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the COVID period, we start using online grocery shopping with click and collect. It has actually been saving us a bit of money as we're not tempted with impulse purchases while walking up and down the ailes. The downside is that the process can actually be quite cumbersome.</p><p>What we do now:</p><ol><li>Spend ages looking for meal ideas for the week</li><li>Collate a list of recipes</li><li>Collate recipe ingredients</li><li>Check the pantry and finalise shopping list</li><li>Order items in shopping list</li></ol><p>Now we haven't been necessarily doing it in that order either, we have been sporadically looking up recipe at a time and adding things to our online shopping cart over time, a lot of time. Now I don't think I can automate this completely but surely there was a better way to help reduce this time with a homelab app. Enter Mealie.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mealie">Mealie<a href="#mealie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mealie" title="Direct link to Mealie">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://hay-kot.github.io/mealie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mealie</a> is a self-hosted recipe manager and meal planner with a RestAPI backend and a reactive frontend application. It has some awesome features but the key ones I hope to leverage are:</p><ul><li>Ability to create a custome recipe book by importing online recipes</li><li>Meal planner to choose our recipes for the week</li><li>Shopping list creator based on our meal plan</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="installing-mealie">Installing Mealie<a href="#installing-mealie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installing Mealie" title="Direct link to Installing Mealie">​</a></h2><p>I'll be using the <code>kompose convert</code> method to install Mealie. I'm not going to cover it again but if you are interested check out my previous post as I installed <strong>Adguard Home</strong> with the same method.</p><p>The <code>kompose convert</code> command generated the following manifest files for me (I renamed them for my convenience):</p><ul><li>01-mealie-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml</li><li>02-mealie-deployment.yaml</li><li>03-mealie-service.yaml</li></ul><p>Deploying these files using <code>kubectl apply -f mealie/</code> deploys mealie in my cluster. Now what I need to do is expose this service to a webbrowser. If you've been following my previous posts, I've tried this in two ways, either giving it a network IP through Metallb or using my reverse proxy Traefik to route it through an internal domain. I'll be using the Traefik method today.</p><p>So to expose my service I create two additional files:</p><p><code>04-mealie-headers.yaml</code> to specify some middleware to force https:</p><div

You might be thinking <em>"mate, that's just the same as local storage"</em> and you would be right but I wanted to eventually switch to a separate NAS so figured I'd just learn how to do this.</p><p>There are plenty of tutorials available on how to install NFS on Ubuntu but i followed this one.

worth mentioning that the kubernetes rescource associated to persistent storage is <strong>Persistent Volumes</strong>. Like any other resource, I can provision persistent volumes declaritively to whatever storage class I specify.</p><p>Once a persistent volume is created, an application deployment can leverage the persistent volume using a <strong>Persistent Volume Claim</strong>.

I found a nifty little tool that someone made called <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFS subdir external provisioner</a> which is an automatic provisioner that uses your existing and already configured NFS server to support dynamic provisioning of Kubernetes Persistent Volumes via Persistent Volume Claims.

The main thing I was happy to see was that Metallb did the job too by assigning the IP <code>192.168.86.100</code> to the traefik service. This means I can now route all incoming request (regardless of which application) to this IP and traefik will handle all the routing. This will be done through domain names which will be covered in a later post.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So now I have a cluster - woot! My first thing was to get stuck in and deploying some apps but quickly realised there were a couple of other things that needed to be considered. Say I deployed a web server to my cluster using a small nginx container. It's up and running but how do I access it when it is only routable within my cluster. if you look at the pods IP addresses, they are all <em>10.1.x.x</em> which is not in my home network.</p><p>Well, the answer is I need use a load balancer to expose that web server outside the cluster so that I can see it on my home network. When working in public cloud, these load balancers are usually provided by the cloud providers but I need one for my locally hosted environment.</p><p>After a bit of research, I found that <a href="https://metallb.universe.tf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metallb</a> is the best solution for this. You give it a "pool" of IP addresses within your home network to allocate to services that you want to expose and it just does it (much like a DHCP server)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="installing-applications">Installing applications<a href="#installing-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installing applications" title="Direct link to Installing applications">​</a></h2><p>So this is my first app that I am going to install on my cluster so it took me a little bit of reading to get to this point but here are my key takeaways of installing this and any app:</p><ul><li>You can specify kubernetes a <em>manifest</em> which is basically a yaml file which allows you to declaritively specify what you want to install, where to install it from and what configurations you want and how to expose it.</li><li>Most container applications are containerised with docker and often come with an associated docker-compose file. There is a nifty tool called <a href="https://kompose.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kompose</a> which allows you to take these docker-compose files and it converts it to a kubernetes manifest for you to allow it to be deployed to your cluster - I plan on using this a lot.</li><li>Another popular way of installing application is Helm. Helm is a package manager similar to apt (if you're familiar with Ubuntu) which allows you to easily install applications on to your cluster. All you need to do is specify the repo for the application you are wanting to install and it does the rest - I plan on using this a lot too.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="installing-metallb">Installing metallb<a href="#installing-metallb" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installing metallb" title="Direct link to Installing metallb">​</a></h2><p>Installing metallb is pretty easy out of the box.

Namespaces are a kubenetes construct that basically allow you a way to organise resources within your cluster. I like to think of them as "folders" in a typical file system. So for metallb, all my resources will live in the metallb-system namespace. This allows for easy troubleshooting in the future as I know where they all live.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="configuring-metallb">Configuring metallb<a href="#configuring-metallb" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Configuring metallb" title="Direct link to Configuring metallb">​</a></h2><p>Once installed, there were some configuration changes that needed to be made.

It boiled down to two main ones: K8s vs K3s. Both K8s and K3s share the same source code but the key difference for me was that K3s was significantly more lightweight, can be deployed much faster and still all all the key capabilities of K8s. There are a number of "production grade" features that are excluded from K3s such has handling of complex applications and intergrations with public cloud providers which I didn't require.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="installing-k3s">Installing K3s<a href="#installing-k3s" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installing K3s" title="Direct link to Installing K3s">​</a></h2><p>Installing K3s couldn't be more easier out of the box and it takes no time at all.

They are actually pretty cool, the specs are much better, the costs aren't that much higher and they are built to last.</p><p>I ended up getting <a href="https://www.centrecom.com.au/intel-nuc-11-essential-kit-celeron-n4505-atlas-canyon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel NUC 11 Essential Kit Celeron N4505 (Atlas Canyon)</a> which was on special at CentreCom. I unboxed and plugged it in immediately only to realise that it is pretty barebones unfortunately. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn1.centrecom.com.au/images/upload/0135473_0.jpeg" alt="NUC" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The site doesn't cover it but it doesn't come with any pre-installed HDD or RAM (that's why it was cheap!) so I needed to get those off Amazon. Here's what I bought:</p><p>2 X <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B08C4Z69LN?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8GB DDR4 RAM</a></p><p>  <img loading="lazy" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71exOjbZWiL._AC_SX679_.jpg" alt="RAM" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>1 x <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418VuyafoUL._AC_SL1075_.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">500GB SSD Hard Drive</a></p><p>  <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.mwave.com.au/images/400/crucial_p5_plus_500gb_nvme_m2_pcie_3d_nand_ssd_ct500p5pssd8_ac46349.jpg" alt="HDD" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Installing them were pretty easy - plug n play, I was then ready to rock n roll!</p>]]></content>

It was time to do this properly. I bought a couple of <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B09NVYV5NB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cable cradles</a> from Amazon that fit nicely under the table. From there it was relativey easy to run all the cables and extension cords through. Here's the final result:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Tidy Cables 1" src="/assets/images/tidycable_1-2736f002b05d87619845557f4efc7816.jpg" width="4080" height="3072" class="img_ev3q">

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been dabbling with a few self hosted services on my laptop or a raspberry pi for a while now but I now have a need to run some of these services on going. I've also wanted to become more comfortable with kubernetes administration so this is also a great opportunity for me to learn something but also run a few practical services at home.</p><p>There are some amazing resources available that I have been leaning on heavily but I find writing things down will help make some of the key concepts stick. I'm hoping I can then transfer some of these skills to my work and future projects.</p><p>I wanted to give a shout out to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@technotim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technotim</a> and <a href="https://noted.lol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted.lol</a> who I've drawn a lot of inspiration from for a number of my services.</p><p>Full disclosure, I'm not one to write blogs so this is a bit of a challenge in itself. I've given myself a bit of license to be a keep things a bit rough as I write to keep myself motivated to continue to post regularly.</p><p>If you're interested feel free to read through my posts and head over to my <a href="/docs/intro">docs</a></p>]]></content>

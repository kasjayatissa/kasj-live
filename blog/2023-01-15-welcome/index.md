I've been dabbling with a few self hosted services on my laptop or a raspberry pi for a while now but I now have a need to run some of these services on going. I've also wanted to become more comfortable with kubernetes administration so this is also a great opportunity for me to learn something but also run a few practical services at home.

There are some amazing resources available that I have been leaning on heavily but I find writing things down will help make some of the key concepts stick. I'm hoping I can then transfer some of these skills to my work and future projects.

I wanted to give a shout out to [technotim](https://www.youtube.com/@technotim) and [noted.lol](https://noted.lol/) who I've drawn a lot of inspiration from for a number of my services.

If you're interested feel free to read through my posts and head over to my [docs](/docs/intro)
